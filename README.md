## Installation

```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# List all registered APIs
httpie-oapi spec list

# Add a new API specification
httpie-oapi spec save --name myapi --url https://api.example.com/openapi.json --base-url https://api.example.com

# Remove an API specification
httpie-oapi spec remove myapi

# Refresh API specification cache
httpie-oapi spec refresh myapi
```

### Command Line Completion

The tool provides intelligent command-line completion based on the OpenAPI specification:

1. When no base URL is matched, it shows all available API specifications
2. When the cursor is on a base URL token, it shows all paths for that API
3. When both base URL and path are matched, it shows all available parameters

Example:
```bash
# Shows all registered APIs
httpie-oapi complete "http "

# Shows all paths for the matched API
httpie-oapi complete "http https://api.example.com"

# Shows all parameters for the matched path
httpie-oapi complete "http https://api.example.com/users"
```

### Fish Shell Integration

Generate fish shell completion:

```bash
httpie-oapi completions --shell fish --output ~/.config/fish/completions/httpie-oapi.fish
```

## Configuration

The tool stores API specifications and configuration in:
- `~/.config/httpie-oapi/config.toml` - Configuration file
- `~/.local/state/httpie-oapi/` - API specification cache
